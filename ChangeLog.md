# Ver. 0.3 (August xx, 2023)

- A new option ``--analyze_with_larger_supercell``, ``--delta_max_natoms``, and ``--max_loop_for_largesc`` were added.
These options enable the calculation of harmonic properties with larger supercells when negative frequencies appear with the default size of supercell.

# Ver. 0.2 (April 3, 2023)

## What's New

- A new option ``--file_structure`` was added. This option enables the automation calculation with an arbitrary structure.

## Modifications
