# Ver. 1.0.0 (Sept. 28, 2025)

## New

- Release the package

- Add 'command_vasp_gam' for Gamma point calculation.

- Modify the structure relaxation with EOS. (Set the maximum number of iteration and strain range.)

- Read the previously-obtained relaxed structure for the volume relaxation (strict optimization).

- Add 'calculate_forces' option. When this option is set to be "0", forces are not calculate but structure with displacement patterns are prepared.

- Add 'four', 'command_anphon_ver2', and 'frac_kdensity_4ph' options.

# Ver. 0.4.0 (April 24, 2023)

## New

- Set the primitive cell tolerance for ALAMODE calculations to match that of Spglib.

## Fix

- Change the minimum number of displacement patterns for LASSO to 10.

# Ver. 0.3 (September 8, 2023)

## New

- New options ``--analyze_with_larger_supercell``, ``--delta_max_natoms``, and ``--max_loop_for_largesc`` were added.
These options enable the calculation of harmonic properties with larger supercells when negative frequencies appear with the default size of supercell.

- A log file ``ak.log`` is created in the working directory. Reading this log file, one can easily know the status of the calculation.

# Ver. 0.2 (April 3, 2023)

## New

- A new option ``--file_structure`` was added. This option enables the automation calculation with an arbitrary structure.

## Fix

- Fix a few bugs

- k-mesh densities are properly selected.

## Modifications

- Variable name: from ``dir_phdb`` to ``base_dir`` in ``ak_script.py``
